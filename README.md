# Replicating Toy Models of Universality

For my March 2024 AI Safety Fundamentals project, I replicated Bilal Chughtai's paper (A Toy Model of Universality)[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.03025]. Due to time and skill constraints, I was only able to test the logit attributions (Section 5.1) and the embeddings and unembeddings (Section 5.2) using MLP models trained on the group C_113, but this was sufficient to confirm the overall thesis of the paper.
